## Introduction

This is a follow-along for Alex Edward's book [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/), which details an HTTP server's creation from start to finish. I'll also add my own inputs at certain points.

- The rough aim is to complete this in ~7 days, while also writing Anki flashcards for important points to commit to memory.

- Instead of writing tests, this will focus on creating testable components such that the tests to be written are fairly obvious. TODOS might be added describing the kind of tests to be written.
