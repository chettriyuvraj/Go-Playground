## Introduction

This is a follow-along for Alex Edward's book [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/), which details an HTTP server's creation from start to finish. I'll also add my own inputs at certain points.

## Progress

- 20/06: A fairly robust basic set of APIs with separation of concerns (no middleware) has been created.
