# README

This is a follow-along for Alex Edward's book [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/), while also adding my own inputs at certain points.

- Instead of writing tests, this will focus on creating testable components such that the tests to be written are fairly obvious. TODOS might be added describing the kind of tests to be written.
